    Description: README for Project 1 to describe what I learned from
completing the project.

    I completed Project 1, meeting all the necessary requirements listed on
Learning Suite. This project was actually my first application I've built using
Javascript to handle the logic of the app. There were certainly some times that
I struggled through the functionality, but ultimately it was a tremendous
learning experience. The hardest part was trying to get the labels working to
display the "placename" for every marker. I eventually managed to successfully
integrate the library Dr. Liddle sent out in slack (googlemaps/js-map-label),
only to find that Google Maps now offers the ability to put a custom label for
markers... I felt that this was probably the better method since it is native
to Google Maps, so I re-modified all my code back to do it the native way.
While I may have lost several hours doing this, I was at least able to learn
some new and interesting things about the loading of the documents. I tried to
format my code as closely to JSLint as I could, with only a few exceptions,
that were just "warnings" from JSLint. This helped me to properly organize my
code. I learned how to call an API using Javascript and how to handle the
response. I also learned a couple of neat tricks, like the query class selector
to get all the geotagged places.
