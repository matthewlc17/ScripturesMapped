    Description: README for Project 1 to describe my experience with
completing the project.

############################### PROJECT 1B ###################################
    Unfortunately, this project took me a tremendous amount of time. Even longer
than project 1a, and I found myself with my wheels spinning quite a bit.
Using animation was something that was completely new to me, and I don't feel
that I had knew quite enough to get the task done. I'm sure there had to be
something simple that I was missing, but I just can't quite figure out what
that is. After spending my entire Friday and Saturday (25+ hours) trying to
figure out the animation, I was left with very little time to modify the other
style aspects of the page, so there is much that I still wish I would have had
time to modify. Overall, I feel good about my work and I feel that my project
came out looking pretty good. I feel that I met (or was at least close to
meeting) all the requirements for the project. I plan to use this ugly
experience with animation as a solid learning experience for future web design.


############################### PROJECT 1A ###################################
    I completed Project 1, meeting all the necessary requirements listed on
Learning Suite. This project was actually my first application I've built using
Javascript to handle the logic of the app. There were certainly some times that
I struggled through the functionality, but ultimately it was a tremendous
learning experience. The hardest part was trying to get the labels working to
display the "placename" for every marker. I eventually managed to successfully
integrate the library Dr. Liddle sent out in slack (googlemaps/js-map-label),
only to find that Google Maps now offers the ability to put a custom label for
markers... I felt that this was probably the better method since it is native
to Google Maps, so I re-modified all my code back to do it the native way.
While I may have lost several hours doing this, I was at least able to learn
some new and interesting things about the loading of the documents. I tried to
format my code as closely to JSLint as I could, with only a few exceptions,
that were just "warnings" from JSLint. This helped me to properly organize my
code. I learned how to call an API using Javascript and how to handle the
response. I also learned a couple of neat tricks, like the query class selector
to get all the geotagged places.
